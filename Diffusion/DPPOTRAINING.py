DPPOTRAINING.py

Fine-tunes the pre-trained 3D Sparse-Trans diffusion policy (threeDSparseTransDiffusion.NoisePredictor)
with Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization (DPPO, Ren et al. 2024), restricted to a single, fixed
environment: one map (chosen via MAP_ID) with one fixed starting position/heading, and the
initial belief state built directly from initialize_gp()'s raw GP prior.

Implemented so far:
    Step 1 (build_environment): resolve the single fixed environment - map csv, starting
        position/heading, and the GP prior/baseline RMSE every episode is scored against.
    Step 2 (compute_step_reward): score one environment step's executed chunk by how much
        reconstruction RMSE improved during that chunk, via the GP/Kalman measurement pipeline,
        minus a penalty proportional to the environment step number (encourages reducing RMSE
        as early in the episode as possible).

    step 3 (DPPO rollout/update loop): output the loglikelihoods of each denoising step

    Step 4/5 (collect_rollouts / RolloutBuffer): run one full multi-step episode (T
        execute-then-replan environment steps, each with a K-step denoising replan) under
        pi_theta_old, score every step's chunk with compute_step_reward, and pack every
        (environment step, denoising step) transition - x_k, x_k_minus_1, k, k_prev,
        old_log_prob, reward - into a flat RolloutBuffer ready for PPO minibatching.

    Step 6 (compute_advantages): real GAE across environment steps (paper Eq. A2) - V_phi is
        evaluated at every environment step's own (evolving) belief state, not just the
        episode's initial one, bootstrapping V(s_{t+1}) into each TD residual. Also returns the
        discounted return-to-go per step, which update_value now regresses toward (Eq. A4)
        instead of the raw one-step reward.

    Step 7 (collect_pooled_episodes / MPI): each training iteration pools NUM_EPISODES_PER_ITERATION
        independent episodes (paper Algorithm 1's "N environments in parallel") against the same
        fixed map, rather than training off one noisy episode per iteration - a single episode's
        reward is dominated by sampling noise (eta=1 stochastic denoising + sensor noise), and
        reusing it for many PPO epochs was previously overfitting to that noise instead of
        learning real signal. Distributed round-robin across MPI ranks if launched under
        mpirun/srun/mpiexec (see get_mpi_context/assigned_tasks_for_rank, same conventions as
        DataCollector_beamsearch.py); falls back to one serial process otherwise.

    Step 8 (visualization / checkpointing): after every iteration, if VISUALIZE is True, saves a
        top-down + 3D trajectory plot of one representative pooled episode to
        `rl correction images/` (plot_iteration_trajectory), so training instability can be
        diagnosed visually instead of only from aggregate RMSE/reward numbers. Always saves the
        current model/value_fn weights to `dppo_checkpoints/` (_save_checkpoint), so a specific
        iteration's policy can be inspected or reloaded later instead of being lost once training
        regresses past it.

    Step 9 (stability guards): collect_pooled_episodes standardizes the pooled row_advantage
        (zero mean, unit std across the whole batch, not per-episode) before PPO uses it, so
        gradient step size stays consistent iteration to iteration regardless of that
        iteration's particular raw advantage scale. _ppo_step/_value_step clip gradient norm to
        MAX_GRAD_NORM on both optimizers - clip_epsilon alone only bounds how much of a step
        counts toward the loss, not how large the underlying gradient is. update_policy also
        tracks an approx_kl per epoch and stops that iteration's remaining epochs early once it
        exceeds TARGET_KL (paper Appendix B's KL-divergence termination criterion) - added
        because clip_fraction telemetry showed clip_epsilon=0.1 still saturating near 100% most
        iterations (see CLIP_EPSILON's comment), meaning multiple epochs per iteration were
        running well past the point where the clipped objective is still trustworthy.

HOW TO RUN:
    Run as a module from the `scripts` directory (not `python DPPOTRAINING.py` from inside
    Diffusion/) so that both the `Diffusion` package and its sibling modules at the scripts
    root (gaussianprocesstraining, evalmetrics, CMAES_classic_singlemap,
    Diffusionplanner_singlemap) are importable:
        python -m Diffusion.DPPOTRAINING

    To parallelize episode collection across multiple processes (e.g. on an HPC node), launch
    under MPI instead - every rank must have the same map_id/env config, and rank 0 is the only
    one that ever performs the policy/value update (others just collect episodes and receive the
    updated weights each iteration):
        mpiexec -n <N> python -m Diffusion.DPPOTRAINING
        srun --mpi=pmix python -m Diffusion.DPPOTRAINING

    DataCollector_beamsearch.py - falls back to a single serial process if mpi4py isn't
    installed or the script isn't launched under mpirun/srun/mpiexec). Each iteration:
      1. collects `num_episodes` FRESH, independent episodes under the CURRENT policy,
         distributed round-robin across MPI ranks, and pools them into one buffer
         (collect_pooled_episodes),
      2. (rank 0 only) updates the policy off the pooled advantage, then updates the value
         function off the pooled return-to-go,
      3. broadcasts the just-updated policy/value weights back to every rank, so next
         iteration's rollout collection on non-zero ranks uses the current policy too.

    Pooling multiple independent episodes - rather than reusing one noisy episode for many PPO
    epochs - is what actually reduces the advantage-estimate variance; a single episode's reward
    is dominated by sampling noise (stochastic eta=1 denoising + sensor measurement noise), which
    previously showed up as policy_loss alternating sign almost every iteration with no net
    reward improvement.

    diffusion.model, value_fn, and both optimizers (with their Adam momentum) persist across
    iterations - only the pooled rollout buffer itself is discarded and replaced every
    iteration, so later iterations build on earlier ones instead of restarting from scratch.
